<p> When young people find learning difficult, adults who work with them in schools or
   colleges are supposed to help them. They might check out how they are getting on from time to time. They might give them extra teaching. They might support them in a lesson or work with them in a small group. </p>

<p>In Sheffield, the help that adults give to young people is described in something called a My Plan. This describes any <strong>assessment</strong> that has been done which might help everybody to understand a young person’s strengths and difficulties. The MyPlan does what it says-it’s <strong>a plan</strong>, so that everybody knows what help needs to be given to a young person, how much help, where it will be given and other important details.
   It also describes what everybody is going to <strong>do</strong> to help the young person. When the help has been given for a while, everybody gets together to <strong> review </strong> the plan and see how well it is working. Often, changes are made to make the MyPlan better.</p>

<p>Sometimes when a young person has had a MyPlan for a while, adults and the young person might feel that a different kind of plan might be needed. They might feel that an Education Health and Care (EHC) Plan should be thought about. EHC plans have replaced Statements of SEN.
An Education Health and Care (EHC) Plan is a legal document which describes a young person’s educational, health and social care needs. It sets out the provision needed to meet those needs and achieve agreed long-term outcomes. It is issued by the local authority after an EHC Needs assessment.
Special schools and Integrated Resources normally only admit pupils with EHC plans. However, an EHC plan does not necessarily mean that a child will need a specialist placement. Many pupils with EHC Plans are successfully supported in mainstream schools. </p>
