<p>We want everyone who visits the Your Local Offer Guide website to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding.</p>


<h2>What are we doing?</h2>

<p>To help us make the Your Local Offer Guide website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>

<p>The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). Weâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the target for the Your Local Offer Guide website.</p>


<h2>How are we doing?</h2>

<p>We're working hard to achieve our goal of Level AA accessibility, but we realise there are some areas that still need improving. The following information explains what we're doing to make that happen.</p>

<h3>Success criteria 1.2.6:</h3>

<p>Only captions are provided. Sign language interpretation can be integrated in the future after the script of the video changes.</p>

<h3>Success criteria 2.1.2:</h3>

<p>The calendar should be ammended so that users can be able to add or remove events using the keyboard.</p>
